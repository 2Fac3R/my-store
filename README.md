The task is to code a simple *API CRUD* using **node/express** connected to MongoDB Cloud.

**Notes**:

- I added a field '*isBlock*' to represent an example of how authorization could work, but obviously it is not what I would do in a real case scenario.
- There is an extra '/*generate*' endpoint to create fake data.

**Dependencies**:

- *Faker*: is used to generate fake data.
- *@hapi/boom*: is used for error handling.
- *joi*: is used for schema description and data validation.

**Improvements / TO DO:**

- API Documentation
- Authorization/Authentication functionality
- Tests 

**Thoughts**:

- All the improvements mentioned above (and others) were implemented in my Python (*Django*) [solution repository](https://github.com/2Fac3R/crm).
